An end-user asks their browser to make a secure connection to a website (e.g.https://www.example.com)
The browser obtains the IP address of the site from a DNS server then requests a secure connection to the website.
To initiate this secure connection, the browser requests that the server identifies itself by sending a copy of its SSL certificate to the browser.
The browser checks the certificate to ensure:
That it is signed by a trusted CA
That it is valid - that it has not expired or been revoked
That it confirms to required security standards on key lengths and other items.
That the domain listed on the certificate matches the domain that was requested by the user.
When the browser confirms that the website can be trusted, it creates a symmetric session key which it encrypts with the public key in the website's certificate. The session key is then sent to the web server.
The web server uses its private key to decrypt the symmetric session key.
The server sends back an acknowledgement that is encrypted with the session key.
From now on, all data transmitted between the server and the browser is encrypted and secure.
